# Eat-Da-Burger!

This is a simple full-stack web app that follows the "Model, View, Controller" architecture and uses Node, Express, MySQL, handlebars, and a simple custom ORM. Users can view a list of burgers in a menu and click a button to "devour" it, placing it in the "devoured" section. They can also add new burgers to the menu with a simple form. All data is saved in the database and persists for all users.
